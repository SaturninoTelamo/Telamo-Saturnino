                                <p>I Learned in this activity is about the visual timeline  or infographic about the Mechanical Era of computing. It showcases different calculating devices and their inventors throughout history, starting from the abacus (1300 AD) and progressing to later inventions. The design is visually appealing, using a collage-like style with images of the devices and their creators. </p>

                                <p>I learned in this activity fow a simple HTML webpage and  a preview of how that webpage would look in a browser The HTML code includes basic personal information (name, address, birthdate, profession), a list of things I like to do, and a list of my preferences. It's a very rudimentary webpage, likely a beginner's project.  The code is straightforward and easy to understand, even for someone with limited HTML knowledge.</p>

                                <p>I learned in this activity is about the wireframe design for a personal webpage or online portfolio. It seems to be a very basic layout with sections for a self-introduction, hobbies and skills, social media links (including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and possibly a notification app), a video section, contact information (phone number and a message option), and credits to the designer.  The design is still in its early stages, as indicated by the placeholder boxes.  </p>

                                <p>I learned about a cross-analysis of emerging trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things.  The analysis highlights the unique characteristics of each technology and their interrelationships.  Specifically, it shows how Artificial Intelligence simulates human intelligence for decision-making, while the Internet of Things focuses on connecting devices for data exchange, and cloud computing provides the infrastructure for storage and processing.</p>
